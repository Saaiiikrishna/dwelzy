Here’s a granular, end-to-end feature implementation checklist. Start ticking off each item as you complete it.

### 🚀 0. Project Foundations

* [x] Initialize Git repo & folder structure
* [x] Create `README.md`, `ChangesMade.md` & `NextSteps.md`
* [x] Populate `ChangesMade.md` with initial entry (repo init)
* [x] Populate `NextSteps.md` with this checklist

---

### 🖥️ 1. Backend (Spring Boot)

* [x] Generate Spring Boot project skeleton (`spring-boot-starter-web`, JPA, PostgreSQL)
* [x] Configure `application.properties` for H2 datasource (development)
* [x] Implement core JPA entities & repositories: User, Booking, Driver, Hub, ShipmentEvent
* [x] Build Authentication module (Spring Security + JWT/OAuth2)
* [x] Expose REST API:

    * [x] `POST /api/v1/auth/login` & `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
    * [x] `POST /api/v1/items/analyze` (image upload)
    * [x] `POST /api/v1/bookings` (create booking)
    * [x] `GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}`
* [x] Integrate Image-Processing Service (Mock implementation with extensible architecture)
* [x] Develop PricingService (volume, distance, surcharges)
* [x] Implement Driver Assignment Scheduler (`@Scheduled`)
* [x] Create Shipment endpoints:

    * [x] `POST /api/v1/scan/process` (shipment scanning)
    * [x] `GET /api/v1/scan/booking/{bookingNumber}/events`

---

### 📊 2. Admin Dashboard (React + TypeScript)

* [ ] Scaffold React app with TailwindCSS
* [ ] Configure environment (`.env`) to point to backend
* [ ] Build authentication flow (login page, token storage)
* [ ] Create core pages/components:

    * [ ] Hub Overview (real-time via WebSocket)
    * [ ] Order List & Detail view
    * [ ] Driver Status Dashboard
* [ ] Implement Axios API wrappers for each backend endpoint
* [ ] Integrate QR-code scanner UI for hub scanning
* [ ] Add error handling & loading states

---

### 📱 3. Android Client (Kotlin)

* [ ] Create Android Studio project (Kotlin, SDK 31+)
* [ ] Add permissions (camera, internet) in `AndroidManifest.xml`
* [ ] Implement authentication (login/register screens, Retrofit + JWT)
* [ ] Build item-scan flow:

    * [ ] Capture/compress image → Retrofit upload
    * [ ] Display analyze result & confirm dimensions
* [ ] Build booking flow screens (details form + map selector)
* [ ] Integrate Pricing response & confirmation button
* [ ] Consume booking endpoints & show booking status
* [ ] Implement push notifications (FCM) for delivery updates

---

### 🚚 4. Driver App Extensions (Android/Kotlin)

* [ ] Expose driver-specific APIs in backend
* [ ] Driver login & assignment list retrieval
* [ ] “Navigate to pickup” via Maps Intent
* [ ] Scan QR at hub (ML Kit or camera + ZXing)
* [ ] Mark pickup/delivery status calls

---

### 🔒 5. Security & Validation

* [ ] Validate all incoming DTOs (Hibernate Validator)
* [ ] Secure endpoints by roles (USER vs DRIVER vs ADMIN)
* [ ] Enable HTTPS & CORS configs
* [ ] Rate-limit image analysis endpoint

---

### 🧪 6. Testing & CI/CD

* [ ] Write unit tests for service & pricing logic
* [ ] Write integration tests for REST endpoints (MockMVC)
* [ ] End-to-end tests for booking flow (Postman/Newman or REST Assured)
* [ ] Setup GitHub Actions pipeline: build → test → deploy

---

### ☁️ 7. Deployment & Monitoring

* [ ] Containerize backend & admin (Dockerfiles)
* [ ] Define `docker-compose.yml` (backend, postgres, mongo?)
* [ ] Deploy to staging (AWS ECS/EKS or DigitalOcean)
* [ ] Integrate Prometheus & Grafana for metrics
* [ ] Configure Sentry for error tracking

---

### 📚 8. Documentation & Handoff

* [ ] Finalize API docs (OpenAPI/swagger)
* [ ] Update `README.md` with setup & run instructions
* [ ] Ensure `ChangesMade.md` is up-to-date
* [ ] Mark this checklist complete and archive

---

Copy this list into your `NextSteps.md`. As each feature is built, check it off, append a summary to `ChangesMade.md`, then move onto the next. Good luck!
