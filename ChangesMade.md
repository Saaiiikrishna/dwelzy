  - **ShipmentEvent**: Event tracking for shipments
  - **BaseEntity**: Common audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt)

- ✅ Built Authentication module:
  - Spring Security configuration
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - UserPrincipal for authentication context
  - Password encoding with BCrypt
  - Role-based method security

- ✅ Exposed REST API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/v1/items/analyze` - Item image analysis
  - `POST /api/v1/bookings` - Create booking
  - `GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}` - Get booking details
  - `POST /api/v1/scan/process` - Process shipment scan
  - `GET /api/v1/scan/booking/{bookingNumber}/events` - Get shipment events
  - `GET /api/v1/test/*` - Test endpoints for different roles

- ✅ Integrated Image-Processing Service:
  - Mock implementation with extensible architecture
  - Item type detection and categorization
  - Dimension and weight estimation
  - Fragility assessment and handling instructions
  - Confidence scoring for analysis results

- ✅ Developed PricingService:
  - Volume-based pricing calculation
  - Distance-based pricing
  - Surcharge handling for special items
  - Fragile item premium pricing
  - Configurable pricing parameters

- ✅ Implemented Driver Assignment Scheduler:
  - `@Scheduled` annotation for automatic assignment
  - Driver availability checking
  - Hub-based assignment logic
  - Status tracking for drivers

- ✅ Created comprehensive DTOs:
  - Request/Response objects for all endpoints
  - Validation annotations for input validation
  - Proper error handling and messaging

#### Security & Configuration
- ✅ CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ JWT security configuration
- ✅ Method-level security with @PreAuthorize
- ✅ Data initialization for roles
- ✅ Password encoding and validation

#### Database Schema
- ✅ Entity relationships properly mapped
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Unique constraints for business keys
- ✅ Audit fields for all entities
- ✅ Enum types for status fields

### Project Foundations - Section 0
**Date**: Current Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

- ✅ Created README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- ✅ Created ChangesMade.md to track project progress
- ✅ NextSteps.md already exists with detailed implementation checklist

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Admin Dashboard (React + TypeScript) - Section 2
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

The next major implementation phase will focus on building the React-based admin dashboard with the following components:
- React app scaffolding with TailwindCSS
- Environment configuration for backend integration
- Authentication flow with JWT token management
- Hub overview with real-time WebSocket updates
- Order management interface
- Driver status dashboard
- API integration with Axios
- QR code scanning functionality
- Error handling and loading states

### Remaining Sections
- 📱 Android Client (Kotlin) - Section 3
- 🚚 Driver App Extensions - Section 4
- 🔒 Security & Validation - Section 5
- 🧪 Testing & CI/CD - Section 6
- ☁️ Deployment & Monitoring - Section 7
- 📚 Documentation & Handoff - Section 8

## 📊 Implementation Statistics

- **Backend API Endpoints**: 8 implemented
- **JPA Entities**: 6 core entities
- **Security Roles**: 4 role types
- **Services**: 5 business services
- **Controllers**: 4 REST controllers
- **DTOs**: 15+ request/response objects

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

1. **Database**: H2 for development, PostgreSQL for production
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access
3. **Architecture**: Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
4. **Validation**: Hibernate Validator for input validation
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized error responses
6. **Scheduling**: Spring's @Scheduled for background tasks
7. **CORS**: Enabled for frontend integration
